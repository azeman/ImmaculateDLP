Ayazel's Immaculate YT-DLP Interface for macOS, using Apple Shortcuts

Official YT-DLP repository: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp

This interface provides extensive audio feedback, something that is quite lacking in most software nowadays. **Every single button makes sound!!!!!** Except for the Cancel button, as it is hard-coded by Apple, unfortunately.

# How to use
Get the shortcut from here: [INSERT LINK HERE]

Launch shortcut directly or through the Share button. 

# About QUICK MODE
‘Quick Mode’ is a way to get stuff done faster. Instead of navigating through menus, your file is downloaded immediately, at the cost of less flexibility. How to disable: Launch shortcut directly WITHOUT ANY URL in your clipboard.
